# Showing an example run for exercising some of the code paths on the CPU (or MPS on Macbooks)
# This script was last updated/tuned on Jan 17, 2026.

# Run as:
# bash runs/runcpu.sh

# NOTE: Training LLMs requires GPU compute and $$$. You will not get far on your Macbook.
# Think of this run as educational/fun demo, not something you should expect to work well.
# You may also want to run this script manually and one by one, copy pasting commands into your terminal.

# The model should be able to say that it is Paris.
# It might even know that the color of the sky is blue.
# Sometimes the model likes it if you first say Hi before you ask it questions.
